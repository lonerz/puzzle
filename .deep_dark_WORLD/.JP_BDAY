Thought I'd give it to you so easily? Haha! That's funny.

Here's a riddle:
Joshua's birthday is quite special.
For its month and day are perfectly paired.
Of another is one a perfect square.
His birthday is neither in the winter or the fall.
And thankfully Joshua likes his birthday.
So, it must not contain a 16.

His birth day is his favorite number.
